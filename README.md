# Biomechanical Analysis of Javelin throw using IMU_sensor_data

## Project 3: A study on Javelin throw anaylsis using Inertial Measurement Units: Application Development

### In this project, I have analysed the technical parameters of Javelin throw and ploted the EDA and checked the reliability of the IMU system, further developed into an application.

* Parameters analysed : Stance duration, Stride time, Stride lenght, Throw acceleration, 
*	Identified key performance parameters through comprehensive literature reviews.
* Data collection and processing using Inertial measurement Units (Xsens suit), force plates, motion capture systems (Vicon), and Optogait for athletes of different experience levels.
* Conducted reliability and validity testing of the Xsens system.
* Applied statistical methods to interpret performance data and developed visualizations, reports for publication.
* Collaborated in developing a real-time feedback application to enhance daily training sessions for javelin throw athletes.
